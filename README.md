### Introduction to Bookie Jar

This application started as a personal project outside of my full time job, which kept me occupied and busy many weekends through the UK lockdown in 2020. As an avid reader, I curated a list of about 1,000 books, from Pulitzer prize winners to Bill Gates' 2020 summer reading list. These are books I have read or I know I would enjoy reading. 

I created Bookie Jar in order to give book recommendations from the above curated selection. My hope for this app is to help like-minded readers find books they would enjoy, and hopefully will help someone find great reads while we all stay at home and practice social distancing.
